 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

 You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
 along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

 As additional permission under GNU AGPL version 3 section 7, you
 may combine this Program with free software programs or libraries that
 are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the standard
 release of the "Flutter" library under the BSD-3-Clause License (or
 modified versions of such code, with unchanged license).
 You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the
 GNU AGPL for this Program and the licenses of the other code concerned.

 Note that people who make modified versions of this Program are not obligated
 to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their
 choice whether to do so. The GNU Affero General Public License gives
 permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
 exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
 carries forward this exception.

                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that
in the case of network server applications, the modified source code becomes
available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users
of that server.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source code. For example, if your program is a web application,
its interface could display a "Source" link that leads to an archive
of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.
